## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r data}
walmart <- read_csv("Walmart.csv")

walmart <- walmart %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"),
         Year = year(Date),
         Month = month(Date, label = TRUE),
         Week = isoweek(Date),
         Holiday = if_else(Holiday_Flag == TRUE, "Holiday", "Regular"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
